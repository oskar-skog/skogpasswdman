0.5     THE BIG CHANGE: change the structure of passwdmangui:
            From:
                Wait a very long time reading /dev/random
            To:
                Use the CLI as engine.  Use a timed loop to read.  And
                Gtk-events to write.
            Pros:
                - Progress-bar.
                - More interactive.
            Try also:
                - Toggle show passwords/don't show without restarting the gui.
*       Use tuples instead of dicts for the makefile-variables.
