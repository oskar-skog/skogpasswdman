skogpasswdman is a program for remembering, generating and updating passwords.
It's also prepared for the future when password protected stuff supports
fake-passwords to catch crackers.

It stores the passwords and honey-pots in unencrypted XML files, they are
expected to be kept safe. You don't need a password for your passwords.

It has infinite undo/redo.

It can tarballize the datafiles, including the infinite undo/redo. NOTE: It
doesn't encrypt the tarball.

Works with Python 2.7 and Python 3.x, should work with Python 2.6.

BUGS:
    Cannot copy-paste to piece of paper.
    
    Sometimes the "Quit"-button must be clicked 3 times.
    
    The --single-backup option in the CLI actually requires 2 undos.
    
    'honeypot' was a poor choice of name, but it grew legs and glued its feet
    to the ground.   The fake-passwords.
