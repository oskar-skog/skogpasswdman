About passwdman

Technical

1.      passwdman is a program for remembering and updating passwords. It
        also has support for honey pots (fake-passwords that activates
        traps).

2.      It requires Python. The graphical use interface requires Gtk3 (with
        python bindings).
        
        The usual: (Type them at the prompt)
            ./configure
            make
            make install

3.      There will be two tabs, one for passwords and one for honeypots.
        Select the password or honeypot and click on the button for the task.
        In the honeypot tab, there is a 'pick'- and 'pick many'-button. They
        do not care about what honeypot you have selected, they choose
        randomly by themselves.

4.      The "--update" option for "configure":
            Required argument: name of the new "configure.2"
            configure only checks for python, extracts a few scripts and
            passes control to "configure.2" (written by "configure").
            
            "configure.2" can update "configure" to contains a newer
            version of "configure.2"
            
            To update the rest of configure: update twice.
        The "--halt" option for "configure":
            Stop "configure.2", so that it can be read.
        
        
        
        If you change configure.2:
            ./configure --halt
            ^C
            ./configure.2 --update configure.2
        (if you changed the update part:
            ./configure.2 --update configure.2
        again)
