passwdman is a program for remembering and updating passwords. It also
remembers honey-pots (fake-passwords to catch crackers).

It stores the passwords and honey-pots in XML files, so they can be read with
a normal text-editor (normal for unix), depending on the user.

It has infinite undo/redo by making backups of the files. It supports Unicode
and uses UTF-8 as encoding.

The XML files are not encrypted, so that you don't need to remember an extra
password.       If you want encryption you should encrypt the whole /home.

It can remember old human-generated passwords, create new passwords (base10
or a variant of base64) with randomized length, update passwords and obviously
show and remove passwords.      The variant of base64 uses underscores=63 and
exclamation marks=62.

It can add, remove honey-pots and randomly choose (pick) honey-pots in two
different flavors.

The GUI (graphical) can copy to clipboard.

The CLI began as a interactive program, but it is no longer the default
behavior. It is quite noisy, but that can be filtered with grep and cut. It
supports 'pipe-through' and comments, as an attempt to make it better. It's
an ed pattern and it will tell which command generated the output.

BUGS:
    Sometimes the "Quit"-button must be clicked 3 times.
    The --single-backup option in the CLI actually requires 2 undos.
