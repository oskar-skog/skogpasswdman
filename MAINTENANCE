This is an abandoned project.  It has been moved to Github to keep my backups
smaller.

Version 0.4.7 is missing. I don't know why.

---- Below is "MAINTENANCE" mostly unmodified from 0.4.17 ----

Good luck, you'll need it!


This place in the no√∂sphere was found by me, Oskar Skog, and I recommend not
coming here.

There's a high level of creeping featurism and uselessness in the atmosphere.
- Useful functionality could use some complete rewriting
- Storage format could be less XMLy
- Undo/redo and "make backup" have both backfired miserably.
- The honeypots, where never usable.
- GNU nano w/ chmod 600 plain text defeated the storage functionality.
- Uglier CLIs cannot be found.

Apart from generating random passwords, this is a piece of shit.


Mail me at gmail.com@oskar.skog.finland in pseudo-reverse if you're interested
in taking over.  If you're not happy with 2-Clause BSD, I'll drop it in public
domain.

On the more serious side:

The master format of the manuals are the mdoc man pages, they are then
converted with doclifter to Docbook XML. The Docbook XML is then repaired
and used as an intermediary format for everything else.

Hack the dist target in the Makefile, if you don't have the tools.

The version number is set in configure, but how?  The file generates a file
which is used to generate the original file when it has been changed.  Huh?
