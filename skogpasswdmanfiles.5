The password list.
It is an XML file, you are expected to understand an example of the file.

<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
<root magic="skogpasswdman" file="passwords" version="0.1">
    <!--The attribute 'magic' may not be changed.
    The major version may not be greater than zero.
    The attribute 'file' is used to make sure that it is the right file.-->

    <passwd name="TEST" value="0123456789">
        <!--A 'passwd'-element is allowed to contain a 'meta'-element.-->

                Digits, big letters, small letters, underscores and
                exclamation marks.
            'minlength' is the minimal length required for the password.
            'maxlength' is the maximal length allowed for the password.
            
            The meta-data is used when updating the password.-->

.Sh Pa ~/.skogpasswdman/honeypots
The list of honeypots.
The honeypots are fake-passwords, to help catch crackers.
This too is a XML file.
.Bd -literal
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
<root file="honeypots" magic="skogpasswdman" version="0.1">
    <!--look at ~/.skogpasswdman/passwords-->
    <honeypot value="BadPassword"/>

</root>
.Ed
.Sh Pa ~/.skogpasswdman/undoable
Backups.
The
.Fn undo
function looks for the newest file and doesn't care about the filename.
If
.Qq passwords
is in the filename, the file is a backup of 
.Pa ~/.skogpasswdman/passwords .
If
.Qq honeypots
is in the filename, the file is a backups of
.Pa ~/.skogpasswdman/honeypots .
It copies the current state to
.Pa ~/.skogpasswdman/redoable
before it restores from the backup.
.Sh Pa ~/.skogpasswdman/redoable
The opposite of
.Pa ~/.skogpasswdman/undoable .
The function is
.Fn redo .
.Sh Pa ~/.skogpasswdman/gui.conf
The GUI configuration file:
.Bd -literal
#Configuration file for skogpasswdmangui.
#If there is any number-sign in a line, the line is a comment.
This is a comment. #
#It knows about 'show_passwd', 'true' and 'false'.
 #It is case sensitive.
show_passwd false
